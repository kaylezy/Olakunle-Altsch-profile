          <h3>A short Biography</h3>
          <p class="about">
            I'm olakunle Hassan by name, The first from the family of five, 3
            boys and 2 girls. Went to Nursery, Primary and Secondary school,
            finish in 2005. After my waec, there was no money to send me to a
            university and was ask to go and learn a craft but i opted to learn
            computer training. After my computer training, i worked as a
            computer operator for 4years. Mind you, I thought not been able to
            send my to university was going to be me alone, but guess, it all
            went round to the rest of my siblings. By 2010 i was able to raise
            some money to get a jamb form in other to get admited to a
            university which i actually got admitted in a polytechnic, i paid
            all the necessary fee but couldnt affort to pay for my tuition fee,
            after the first semester, all the student that could not pay their
            tuition fee was ask to drop out and deactivated from the school
            portal, i came back home sad. After some month, i started looking
            for job and fortunately for me, i got a job of office assistance,
            worked for 4years, save some money and enrolled for a part time
            degree which will allow me work and study at the same time. By 2018,
            i was done with school, that was when i faced the real world
            challenge, i could not get any job with my part time certificate
            because i dont have a nysc certificate to back up my degree
            certificate. I was fed up with life, because all my thought was to
            go to school, get a degree and start earning money to help my family
            but then all hope was lost becuase i couldnt get a job. By 2021 when
            Altschool launches their first ever program which I signed up for, I
            passed and was a student until I was kicked out because I couldnt
            afford the school fee and there was no scholarship then but I never
            gave up. I started learning on my own with some online free courses
            just to brush myself up but I kept giving up along the line because
            there was no partner in learning. Fast forward to this year when
            hacksultan twitted about the scholarship to gain access to
            Altschool, I signed up for it again because I really want to do tech
            since i counld not get a job with my degree, paid for my
            registration fee, wrote my exam, pass and became a student. As an
            accounting graduate who is passionate about tech, I believe that my
            passion for technology, specifically in the web development. I know
            transitioning in to tech might be a little bit challenging. However,
            I have used my time to learn the basics of frontend development to
            develop my tech skills and dedicated to work in a challenging work
            environment with great prospect for intensive training and
            subsequent applicaiton of knowledge and skills to solve practical
            problems in real life situation.
